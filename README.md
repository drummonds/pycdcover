# pycdcover
Tools for creating optical disc covers (cd, dvd, blu-ray).    
I wanted a tool that would print covers with identifying information eg ID's of content, so each one should be different.

Also to be able to easily align to the particular printer that you are using.
I also want it as a package that I can install from Pypi.

Thanks to https://github.com/JeffOwOSun/CDCoverGenerator which is where I started.
